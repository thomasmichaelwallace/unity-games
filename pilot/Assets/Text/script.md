# _init_
There was a plane.
There was *always* a plane.

[We took a look](take_a_look)
[We stepped back](step_back)

# take_a_look
Taking a look was interesting, but there wasn't much to see.

[!](!)

# step_back
We took a step back.
Everything started **shaking**.

[We shook](!)
[We won.](_win_)

# pilot
Oh. The sea.
I liked it,
But I never loved it.

[!](!)

# wings
The wings looked pretty bent out of shape.
They certainly weren't gonna be the wind behind anyone soon.

[I took another look](_init_)
[I smashed them with a baseball bat](_close_)

# _win_
You got away.
Which was good.

# _lose_
The end. And death.
