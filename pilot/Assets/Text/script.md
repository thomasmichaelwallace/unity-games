# _init_

you made it.
there's a plane.
you need this.

[you shoot the pilot. how hard can it be to fly a plane?](shoot_the_pilot!)
[you take a moment to look around.](!)

# shoot_the_pilot!

the pilot pulls out a gun and shoots you before your fingers even glance the trigger.
the last thing you see are a resigned pair of eyes.
you're not the first desperate soul to try and shoot your way out.
you won't be the last.

# _body_

the fuselage is covered in scratches and dents. this plane has seen better days.
you can just about make out the name "hope flies eternal" in peeling letters on the side.

[a few splotches of new paint are conspicuous against the general disrepair.](new_paint)
[a mess of welds score a deep line along the keel.](weld)

# new_paint

the new paint is pretty cheap. you can see the ghost of what came before. a line down the middle separates two sets of mark of heights, and maybe even ages. you remember making similar marks on the kitchen door as a kid. you can just about make out the name on the left: "dave". the right, is lost to time.

[!](!)

# weld

looking at the state of the repair, this plane has been around for a long time.

**pilot**: "my brother did that. landed too close to the pontoon one day. mom made him do the repair. it took him all night. didn't make him any better at landing, though."

[!](!)

# _fin_

the fin is a different colour from the rest of the plane. in fact, it looks like it's from another plane.

[without any effort you can rock it side to side.](rock_fin)
[is that a bullet hole?](bullet_hole)

# rock_fin

this piece of junk is falling apart. but then, it's the last plane left. let's hope it makes it pass the second island to the right, and then straight 'til morning. makes the bunker sound like neverland...

[!](!)

# bullet_hole

you look through the hole and spy old george's junk heap. hard to imagine why *he'd* start shooting planes; not like he didn't have enough spare parts without making more of his own. but then, these aren't normal times...

[!](!)

# _propellers_

a few lines are notched along each propeller. you bet they make an impressive set of circles when the blades are spinning.

[an unexpected smiley face sticker sits on the shaft.](smiley)
[you stare absently as they tumble in the wind...](stare)

# smiley

the smiley face looks sinister; reflecting the light of the fire from the old geroge's shed. hard to know what started it, but i bet those cans of fuel will keep it burning long after we've gone.

[!](!)

# stare

hard to imagine that, only a few hours ago, you were sitting at the bar drinking. then came the news report...
what was that bartender's name? dave? nice guy... shame he didn't make it.

[!](!)

# _wings_

water drips from the wings as they catch the ocean spray. a rainbow forms beneath them. a pleasant sight, any other time.

[you reach out to touch it.](rainbow)
[on top, there are a pair of boot prints.](boots)

# rainbow

you pull your hand back when you realise the sheen is mostly oil. there's a hasty looking patch repair just below the tank. looks like this plane isn't going anywhere without some more fuel.

[!](!)

# boots

fresh mud and wet sand. looks like this pilot's been for a run across the island. but then, anyone still alive now, must have ran...

[!](!)

# _floats_

the floats dip in and out of the water as the waves slowly pass the plane by. shoals of fish swim around them.

[a long scratch runs along the bottom.](scratch)
[one looks newer than the other.](replace)

# scratch

hard to imagine why a pilot this reckless is still waiting...

[!](!)

# replace

looks like a recent repair job. hard to imagine old geroge would have give up any spare parts without demanding a ticket off this island... can't see him any where.

[!](!)

# _pilot_

the pilot just stares at the island. serene. you could almost believe they didn't know what happened. *almost*.

[you take a closer look at the plane.](!)
[there's not much time. you start to bargain](start)

#Â start

**you**: "things are pretty bad back there."
**pilot**: "yup."

[what's keeping you here?](keeping_you_here)
[that your plane?](that_your_plane)

# that_your_plane

**pilot**: "yup."

[why are you still here?](keeping_you_here)

# keeping_you_here

**pilot**: "i'm waiting for someone."
**you**: "there aren't that many *someones* left..."
**pilot**: "he'll get out. he has to."

[your brother?](your_brother)
[maybe...](maybe)

# maybe

**pilot**: "what do you know about it?"

[your brother dave?](your_brother)
[your son james?](your_brother_james)

# your_brother

**pilot**: "that's right."

[i was there. no one else made it.](no_one_else)
[dave?](your_brother_dave)
[james?](your_brother_james)

# your_brother_james

**pilot**: "..."
**you**: "james told me you were here. just before he..."
**pilot**: "get out of here."

[!](not_your_brother!)

# not_your_brother!

**pilot**: i haven't got time to waste on your chancing. i've got a brother to wait for. find your own way back.

# your_brother_dave

**pilot**: "..."
**you**: "dave told me you were here. just before he..."
**pilot**: "i said i'm waiting for him."

[sure.](sure)
[i was there. no one else made it.](no_one_else)

# no_one_else

**pilot**: "..."

[so let's just get out of here...](push_too_hard!)
[at least, it didn't look that way...](sure)

# push_too_hard!

**pilot**: "my brother's alive. i know it. and i haven't *got* to take you anywhere. get out of my sight."

# sure

**you**: "so."
**pilot**: "so."

[looks like you're out of fuel](offer_fuel)

# offer_fuel

**pilot**: "i don't need your help."
**you**: "even if i know where to find some?"

[there's a few jerry cans in the shed back there](jerry!)
[there's some in the lock-up. i've got a crowbar. no one will miss it now.](crowbar)

# jerry!

the pilot nods are the shed. you turn to see it's ablaze.

**pilot**: "get out of here. i'm waiting for my brother."

# crowbar

**pilot**: "a crowbar? ain't you prepared."
**you**: "still don't need help?"

[looks like you had a rocky landing](fuel_landing)

# fuel_landing

**pilot**: "nothing i couldn't fix."
**you**: "looks it."

[lucky you found a spare float...](spare_float)

# spare_float

**pilot**: "yeah. lucky."
**you**: "seem to remember old george used to guard that junk heap like it was his baby. said he was saving up for a whole plane."

[i guess you, *persuaded* him](george)

# george

**pilot**: "i did what i had to do"

[you shot him?!](shot_him!)
[you did what you had to do.](had_to_do)

# shot_him!

the pilot throws your a suspicious glance.
out of nowhere, the pilot shoots you too.

# had_to_do

**pilot**: "looks like i can trust you."

[know where you're going? with your brother, i mean](where_to_go)

# where_to_go

**pilot**: "not in so many words. at the moment, *away* seems best."
**you**: "yeah."

[i know a place...](i_know_a_place)

# i_know_a_place

**pilot**: "good for you."
**you**: "could be good for you too."
**pilot**: "what?"

[all this, it's not just happening here you know. it was on the tv.](on_the_tv)
[i've got money...](money!)

# money!

the pilot shoots you.

**pilot**: "good. now i've got money. just gotta wait for my brother."

# on_the_tv

**pilot**: "the tv?"
**you**: "in the bar. that's where i met dave. before *it* started happening here."
**pilot**: "..."

[you know he's not coming. right?](no_coming)

# no_coming

**pilot**: "..."

[i've got money...](money!)
[i saw you running. from the bar.](running)

# running

**pilot**: "..."

[...](dot_dot_dot)

# dot_dot_dot

**pilot**: "i panicked. i just thought, if i got the plane ready. maybe..."
**you**: "i get it."
**pilot**: "he's not coming is he?"
**you**: "i'm sorry"

[but we can still get away](_win_!)

# _win_!

As the plane takes off, you look back to see a figure running down the pontoon.
The pilot, distracted by your directions, doesn't see him. 
You did what you had to do...
